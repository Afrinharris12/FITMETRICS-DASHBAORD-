# FITMETRICS-DASHBAORD
This month marked my first-ever participation in the Onyx Data Challenge, and I have to say — I’m impressed. The way Onyx designs realistic, industry-inspired scenarios pushes you to think beyond numbers and truly tell a business story with data.

It was also my first time working this deeply in Tableau — exploring its capabilities far beyond basic charts. Every click, every calculated field, every parameter brought me closer to uncovering the story hiding beneath the surface.

In this challenge, I took on the role of a Data Analyst at MyGym, a fast-growing fitness center chain in California. With multiple locations, tiered memberships, diverse subscription models, and premium amenities, the dataset was a rich playground for analysis.

🔍 Key Insights

📈 Membership Trends

2023 had the highest membership (692 members), followed by 648 members in 2024.

Premium memberships generated the highest revenue every year.

💸 Discounts

“No discount” dominated each year — perhaps members didn’t need incentives to join.

🕒 Access Hours & Training

All-hours access drove the most revenue.

Group and personal training each had strong years — both highly impactful.

📍 Locations

Fresno led in 2022–2024, San Diego topped 2025.

💡 Amenities by Gender

Females preferred the sauna more than drinks.

Males used both amenities evenly.
