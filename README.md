# FITMETRICS-DASHBAORD
This month marked my first-ever participation in the Onyx Data Challenge, and I have to say — I’m impressed. The way Onyx designs realistic, industry-inspired scenarios pushes you to think beyond numbers and truly tell a business story with data.

It was also my first time working this deeply in Tableau — exploring its capabilities far beyond basic charts. Every click, every calculated field, every parameter brought me closer to uncovering the story hiding beneath the surface.

In this challenge, I took on the role of a Data Analyst at MyGym, a fast-growing fitness center chain in California. With multiple locations, tiered memberships, diverse subscription models, and premium amenities, the dataset was a rich playground for analysis.
